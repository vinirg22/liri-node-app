# liri-node-app

LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

The liri node app allows you to search different categories of either concerts, movies, and songs through the spotify.

The process involves different packages to the Bands in Town, Spotify and OMDB APIs. The packages that were used are:

-Node-Spotify-API

-Axios

-Moment

-DotEnv

I started out but creating and installing, and requiring these packages.

Then I used them to retrieve the information based on my code.

Concert this was the first part, followed by spotify this song, movie this, and lastly the command do what it says.

The technology used for this app was "Node.js"
